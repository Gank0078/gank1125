I'm a second-year Ph.D. candidate from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes semi-supervised learning and long-tailed learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tong Wei](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/weit/) of [PALM group](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/), Southeast University.
